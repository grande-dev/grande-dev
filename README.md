I am a Research Fellow at University College London, Mechanical Engineering.  
Current research interests encompass **computer-aided methods** to synthesise **Lyapunov Functions**, combined with **formal methods** to certify their correctness, and on hardware and onboard software design of **Autonomous Underwater Vehicles**.
