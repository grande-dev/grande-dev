### Welcome ðŸ‘‹


- I am working as a Research Assistant @University College London
- Current research interests encompass **computer-aided methods** to synthesise **Lyapunov Functions**, combined with **formal methods** to certify their correctness. My research focusses on employing these techniques to streamline the design of **Fault Tolerant Control** laws, with specific application to **Autonomous Underwater Vehicles**.
